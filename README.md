# ZK Paper Reading Plan

### Reasons and Purposes of this Plan

- Papers of Zero Knowledge Proof are always very long and sometimes difficult to understand, which leads us to read one paper for many days or even for some weeks. Especially for some details of these papers, We usually cannot understand them very well immediately.  All of the above situations will wear down our confidence in continuous reading. Therefore, we need this plan to record which papers we have read and which papers we need to read next, and to record our patience and the sense of accomplishment.

  

- A good Paper Reading Plan help us organize the ideas and the relations of those papers. with the help of this plan, two or more persons even can read different related papers simultaneously base on short comments about these related papers, which is easy to get from "Abstract" and "Introduction" sections in one paper. Therefore, this plan may shorten the reading cycle for our term.

  

- Getting started with Zero Knowledge Proof is hard for freshmen. Records in this plan may help newcomers adapt to reading Zero Knowledge Proof papers and catch up with us.
