# ZK Paper Reading Plan

### Reasons and Purposes of this Plan

- Papers of Zero Knowledge Proof are always very long and sometimes difficult to understand, which leads us to spend many days or even some weeks on reading one paper. Especially for some details of these papers, We usually cannot understand them very well immediately.  All of the above situations will wear down our confidence in continuous reading. Therefore, we need this plan to record which papers we have read and which papers we need to read next, and to record our patience and the sense of accomplishment.



- A good Paper Reading Plan help us organize the ideas and the relations of those papers. with the help of this plan, two or more persons can even read related different papers simultaneously base on some short comments which can be got easily from "Abstract" and "Introduction" sections in one paper . Therefore, this plan may shorten the reading cycle for our term.

  

- Getting started with Zero Knowledge Proof is hard for freshmen. Records in this plan may help newcomers adapt to reading Zero Knowledge Proof papers and catch up with us.
